# 👋 Hey there!

I’m a 16-year-old developer and student at **The Abelard School**, currently in grade 11. My journey into tech started when I was 12, and since then, I've been exploring programming, diving deep into **Linux**, and embracing the world of **FOSS** (Free and Open-Source Software).

## 👨‍💻 My Projects
I’m passionate about creating tools that make life easier, especially when they’re open-source and accessible to everyone. My recent projects focus on desktop utilities and productivity enhancements. I love working on anything that makes systems faster, more customizable, and efficient.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools
- **Languages**: Python, Bash, and a bit of JavaScript.
- **OS**: Linux
- **Tools**: Vim, VS Code, Git, and other terminal-based utilities
